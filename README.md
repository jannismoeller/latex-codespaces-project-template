# Latex Codespaces Project Template

Create a repository from this template and within this repository start a Github Codespace.
There you can edit and build your latex project (using the *latexmk (latexmkrc)* recipe).

You can also import the project into your Overleaf Account, if you have Overleaf Pro access and connected you Github account to it.
This will require manual pushing and pulling of changes in Overleaf to sync the Github repository.
